# E-Commerce-Management

## Building an ECommerce Management System

The purpose of this project is to create a database using Sequelize. In the database, four models are created and they are: Category, Product, ProductTag, and Tag. Developing this project demonstrates our back-end development skills using Mysql2, Nodejs, Express js, Dotenv, and Sequelize.

This project was developed with Sequelize version ^5.22.5 Using Sequelize assisted in forming and structuring of the database models. Along with forming the models, Sequelize was used for seeding, and the management of data. Insomnia was used to implement Express js methods.

The following is an image of the data output from a method request made using Express js in Insomnia.
